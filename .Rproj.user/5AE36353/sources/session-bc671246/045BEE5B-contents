# Motivation

[KIP-750](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=181308223),
which specifies that Apache Kafka 4.0 will require Java 11, was
approved in June 2021. This was a few months before Java 17 was released
and well before there was clarity regarding the timeline of Apache
Kafka 4.0.

A few things have changed since:

1.  Java 17 was released in September 2021 including Records ([JEP 395](https://openjdk.org/jeps/395)), Sealed Classes ([JEP 409](https://openjdk.org/jeps/409)), Switch Expressions ([JEP 361](https://openjdk.org/jeps/361)), Text Blocks ([JEP 378](https://openjdk.org/jeps/378)), Pattern Matching for instanceof ([JEP 394](https://openjdk.org/jeps/394)), [`Stream.toList` ](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html#toList())and more.

2.  Java 21 was released in September 2023. 

3.  Apache Kafka 4.0 is likely to be released in [Q3 2024](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1012%3A+The+need+for+a+Kafka+3.8.x+release).

4.  Several
    popular projects have set Java 17 (or newer) as the minimum supported
    version or have announced plans to do so in the near future: [Jetty 12](https://eclipse.dev/jetty/), [Apache Spark 4.0](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44111), [Spring 6](https://spring.io/blog/2021/09/02/a-java-17-and-jakarta-ee-9-baseline-for-spring-framework-6/), [Spring Boot 3](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Release-Notes), [Quarkus 3.7](https://quarkus.io/blog/java-17/), [Apache Tomcat 11](https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html). This is also being considered for [Apache Flink 2.0](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/2.0+Release), but hasn't been voted on yet.

5.  Apache
    Kafka 3.7, due in January 2024, will include official docker images for
    the first time. This deployment model includes the Java runtime (Java
    21 in the initial version) and it aims to abstract the Java version from
    users who do not run custom code within the kafka broker (the majority
    of users).

There are a few additional considerations:

1.  Even
    though Java 11 was released in September 2018 (over 5 years ago) and
    usage is on a downward trend, it is still commonly used.

2.  A
    deprecation period is required before we remove support for a given Java
    version and the removal should happen in a major Kafka release.

3.  Important
    projects we depend on may remove support for Java 11 before we do,
    which may result in challenges when it comes to updates required due to
    CVEs. One example is [Jetty 12](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/issues/10485), which requires Java 17.

4.  It
    is often harder to upgrade the Java version in applications that embed
    libraries (like kafka clients or kafka streams) than it is to do so for
    services (like kafka brokers). Connect is somewhere in between as some
    connectors may have library dependencies that do not work with newer
    Java versions.

Balancing the various aspects, **we propose only deprecating
Java 11 support for the kafka broker, its dependent modules and the
tools module in Apache Kafka 3.7 with support being dropped in Apache
Kafka 4.0. The remaining modules (clients, streams, connect, etc.) will
continue to support Java 11.** This approach is similar to the one introduced by Elasticsearch 8.0 where the [server requires Java 17](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/migrating-8.0.html), but the [client requires an older Java version](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/getting-started-java.html).

# Public Interfaces

None.

# Proposed Changes

-   Deprecate
    Java 11 build for the kafka broker and its dependent modules in Kafka
    3.7: update documentation including the downloads page.

-   In Kafka 4.0:

    -   Set `sourceCompatibility/targetCompatibility/release` to `17` for the relevant modules in `build.gradle.`

    -   Remove all Java 11 specific code from the relevant modules.

    -   Update
        Readme and documentation (including the downloads page) to specify Java
        17 as a requirement for the kafka broker and relevant modules. All
        other modules (including clients, streams and connect) would continue to
        require Java 11 (as specified by [KIP-750](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=181308223)).

-   The
    affected modules are: kafka-server-common, kafka-server, kafka_2.13,
    kafka-storage, kafka-metadata, kafka-group-coordinator, kafka-raft,
    kafka-shell, kafka-tools.

# Compatibility, Deprecation, and Migration Plan

Users
who have not and cannot upgrade the Java version used by the kafka
brokers to Java 17 can continue to use Kafka 3.x until they can upgrade
the given cluster. This can be done incrementally since the protocol is
compatible independently of the Java version.

# Rejected Alternatives

1.  Continue supporting Java 11 for the server modules.
